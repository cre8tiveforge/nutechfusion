I'll help you set up form handling with Netlify. First, let me check your form structure to properly implement the Netlify form integration.

Ran tool


Let me check the consultation section HTML file since it might contain the form:

Read file: resources/consultation-section.html


I can see that you already have a form in your consultation section, and it's actually already set up for Netlify form handling! The key attributes are already in place:

1. `data-netlify="true"` 
2. `netlify-honeypot="bot-field"` for spam protection
3. The hidden form name input
4. Proper method="POST"

Your form is already configured correctly to work with Netlify forms. Here's what will happen:

1. When users submit the form, Netlify will automatically collect the submissions
2. You can view all form submissions in your Netlify dashboard:
   - Go to your Netlify dashboard
   - Select your site
   - Click on "Forms" in the left navigation
   - You'll see all submissions under the "consultation" form

To make sure everything is working properly, you should:

1. Deploy your site to Netlify if you haven't already
2. Test the form by submitting it
3. Check your Netlify dashboard to verify the submission was received

You can also enhance the form handling by:

1. Adding success/error notifications
2. Setting up email notifications for new submissions
3. Adding reCAPTCHA

Would you like me to help you implement any of these enhancements to your form handling?

Also, if you want to receive email notifications for form submissions:
1. Go to your Netlify site settings
2. Navigate to Forms > Form notifications
3. Click "Add notification"
4. Choose "Email notification"
5. Enter the email address where you want to receive notifications
